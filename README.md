Two Number Sum <br/>
Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. <br/>
If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any order. <br/>
If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array. <br/>
<br/>
Note that the target sum has to be obtained by summing two different integers in the array. You can't add a single integer to itself to obtain the target sum, <br/>
<br/>
You can assume that there will be at most one pair of numbers summing up to the target sum. <br/>
